                <p>good afternoon. my name is ryan and i've just started this as a bit of a playground, or sandbox. i'm learning how to code various languages and i wanted to create a website to practice my skills and continue to grow. i'm starting with html and css which i have limited experience with as i grew up, but things have changed so much. i'm from lincoln, nebraska and currently work as a software quality engineer for a website you've heard of. please continue to check back for updates.</p>
